## Stage 2 — Parts Ordered

Parts have been ordered.

Ordered components:

## Stage 3 — Bench Testing Plan

The first bench tests will focus on proving each part of the system works before building the final control box or installing anything in the car.

### Test 1 — Rotary Encoder + LEDs

Goal: confirm that the ESP32-C3 can read the rotary encoder and control the WS2812B LED strips through the SN74AHCT125N level shifter.

Planned behaviour:

- Encoder rotation adjusts LED brightness
- Encoder button changes LED mode
- LEDs receive data through the SN74AHCT125N level shifter
- Test one LED strip first, then both left and right outputs

### Test 2 — Add Accelerometer

Goal: add MPU6050 accelerometer input once the LED and encoder system is working.

Planned behaviour:

- Acceleration increases LED brightness/intensity
- Braking triggers a red pulse
- Cornering creates left/right LED effects

### Test 3 — Full Bench System

Goal: test the complete system outside the car before building the final control box.

Planned setup:

- ESP32-C3
- SN74AHCT125N level shifter
- Rotary encoder
- MPU6050
- Left and right LED strips
- 5V power supply or buck converter

## Stage 4 — Bench Testing Results

Bench testing results will be recorded here as each test is completed.

### Test 1 — Rotary Encoder + LEDs

**Date:** 15/07/26  
**Status:** Done

**Setup:**

- ESP32-C3 powered by USB
- Rotary encoder connected to ESP32-C3
- WS2812B LED strip connected through SN74AHCT125N level shifter
- LED strip powered from 5V supply

**Goal:**

Confirm that the rotary encoder can control LED brightness and modes.

**Result:**

Pass.

**Notes:**

- The SN74AHCT125N correctly shifted the 3.3V data signal to 5V.
- Brightness adjustment responded smoothly throughout the configured range.
- Encoder button reliably cycled through all four LED modes.
- No wiring faults or unexpected behaviour were observed.
- Test confirms the ESP32-C3, custom PCB, rotary encoder, level shifter and LED strip are functioning correctly and are ready for accelerometer integration in Test 2.

### Test 2 — Add Accelerometer

**Date:** 16/07/26  
**Status:** Done

**Setup:**

- ESP32-C3
- MPU6050 / GY-521 accelerometer
- Rotary encoder
- WS2812B LED strip
- SN74AHCT125N level shifter

**Goal:**

Confirm that acceleration, braking, and cornering inputs can affect the LED behaviour.

**Result:**

Pass.

The MPU6050 communicated successfully with the ESP32-C3 over I²C. All four firmware modes operated as expected, with LED colours and brightness responding correctly to changes in accelerometer orientation and movement.

**Notes:**

- Initial communication with the MPU6050 was unreliable due to poor solder joints on the ESP32-C3 header pins.
- After reflowing the solder joints, I²C communication became stable and the accelerometer was detected successfully.
- MPU6050 initialised successfully with no further communication errors.
- Longitudinal axis (X) correctly distinguished acceleration and braking.
- Lateral axis (Y) correctly detected left and right movement.
- Mode 1 accurately displayed acceleration (orange), braking (red), and stationary (blue).
- Mode 2 accurately displayed left movement (green), right movement (purple), and stationary (blue).
- Mode 3 correctly varied white LED brightness based on movement intensity.
- Sensor orientation matched the expected vehicle mounting direction.
- Bench testing confirmed correct accelerometer operation prior to vehicle installation.

### Test 3 — Full System Breadboard Test

**Date:** 16/07/26
**Status:** Done

**Setup:**

- ESP32-C3
- MPU6050
- Rotary encoder
- Left and right WS2812B LED strips
- SN74AHCT125N level shifter
- Breadboard prototype
- USB power

**Goal:**

Confirm that the complete hardware system operates correctly before manufacturing the custom PCB.

**Result:**

Pass.

The complete system operated successfully on a breadboard. All hardware components communicated correctly and the firmware responded as expected to simulated vehicle movement.

**Notes:**

- Left and right LED strips operated independently.
- Rotary encoder correctly adjusted brightness.
- Accelerometer correctly detected acceleration, braking and cornering.
- Breadboard prototype confirmed PCB design before manufacture.
- Firmware architecture was successfully validated prior to PCB assembly.

## Stage 5 — PCB Design

Designed a custom PCB in EasyEDA to replace the breadboard prototype.

The PCB integrates:

- All power and signal routing completed.
- PCB passed ERC and DRC checks.
- Gerber files generated and submitted to JLCPCB for manufacture.

## Stage 6 — Firmware Development

Key improvements included:

- Dynamic baseline filtering for hill compensation.
- Improved colour blending.
- Startup animation.
- Idle breathing effect.
- Solid colour modes.
- Removal of diagnostic operating modes.

See `firmware/README.md` for the complete firmware version history.
